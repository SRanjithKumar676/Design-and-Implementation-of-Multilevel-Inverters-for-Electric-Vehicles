🔋 Design and Implementation of Multilevel Inverters for Electric Vehicles 🚗⚡
This repository contains the final year B.Tech project submitted to the Department of Electrical & Electronics Engineering, Mother Theresa Institute of Engineering & Technology.

📘 Abstract
This project presents the design and implementation of a 53-level Multilevel Inverter (MLI) topology using a Switched Capacitor (SC) approach for Electric Vehicle (EV) applications. The topology significantly reduces the number of switches, gate driver circuits, and component count, offering a more compact, efficient, and cost-effective inverter solution.

The system integrates:

Solar PV panels with MPPT (Perturb & Observe algorithm).

A Single Input Multi-Output (SIMO) DC-DC boost converter.

A 17-level SC-based MLI, simulated in MATLAB/Simulink and verified via hardware implementation.

Performance metrics include low Total Harmonic Distortion (THD < 5%), under dynamic load conditions.
